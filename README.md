Can I Play? The Scoreboard that cares!
======================================

This is just a fun project I made to keep track of when I *should* be going to bed and not playing games.

Of course, there's some leeway. If you're winning, why would you stop? But if you have a losing streak AND it's time.. probably time to quit?
